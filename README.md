# TapeLib
**TapeLib is a library originaly created for the purpose of the creation of the mod called RewindBox in Worldbox, but since the library can be used for creating multiplayer so it is now public.**

# How to use
**To use TapeLib you must include the Assembly-Csharp DLL thats in the file and then just include all of the code in your mod project, (TapeLib isnt compiled to DLL for legacy code support) then you can just modify the code for whatever you want.**

# Solution (How it works)
**Well basically recording the behaviour in WorldBox is nearly impossible as the code isnt optimized for that, BUT the solution on how this works is by recording the sprites of the objects, wich is a pretty bad and hacky solution but its the only one that i found.**
